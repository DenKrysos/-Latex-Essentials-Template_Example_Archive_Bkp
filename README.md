# -Latex-Essentials-Template_Example_Archive_Bkp

Just some Templates and Examples for how to use certain Latex Features -- like Tables, Graphics, Captions, etc..
Centrally collected inside a separate Project/Repository to avoid clashes by diverging copies on multiple locations.
This can then be linked or copied on demand into other Documents. (Nothing to compile by itself)

Follows a matching directory structure with my other Boilerplates:<br/>

## Usage

Mainly Notes for myself.<br/>

Things collected in here

* The DenKr_Comments feature, i.e. the File "./0organization/1main/2includes/setup/DenKr_comments__sty.tex"
  * Alongside a template File for setting this up. See the first lines inside this File for further comment.




## Overleaf
The Basis for this is actually an Overleaf Project. This is linked with a GitHub-Repository and every now and then synchronized to this. So the Git-Repo is actually "only" a fork of the Overleaf-Project.
