The data to plot is stored as Comma-Separated-Values in the corresponding .csv Files.
It is also possible to directly write it into the .tex-Document.

The .tex Files (graph\_overhead.tex, graph\_workload.tex) supply example code to visualize that. Paste that somewhere or for example put such files into your "graphics"directory and include it.

\input{"\DenKrGraphicsRootDir/graph_overhead".tex}%
\input{"\DenKrGraphicsRootDir/graph_workload".tex}%
